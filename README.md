## Learning Experience
1. Explored the starter code by familiarizing myself with the UI and JS functionality provided to get an understanding of the project's  current 
    state and what I need to do.
2. Completed User Stories by writing the JS code necessary to bring the stories to life.
3. Testing and Debugged  by testing the app to ensure that it works as expected for a smooth user experience.

## Challenges Faced
   - Fetching elements using the correct Ids and classes
   - Uderstanding how the application should fully function

## Skills Learnt
   - Debugging
   - Critical Thinking
   - Analyzing

## Area of Improvement
   - Debugging
   - Javascript Functions

## Learning overview
   Working on this project was highly challenging because the code was not entirely written in an order I expected like defining a function at th top then calling it at the end, some functions were defined at the bottom but called on other event listeners at the top. It was confusing and secondly as a student with basic understanding of javascript functions and methods I found it hard to read someone else's code and understand what they were trying to achieve but overall it was worth it because I learnt a lot and got to fully understand some functions that confused me.
